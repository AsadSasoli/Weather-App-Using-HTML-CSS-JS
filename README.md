# Weather-App-Using-HTML-CSS-JS
Here's an example of how you can display weather information on your website using RapidAPI and Yahoo Weather API
Make sure to replace 'YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY' with your actual RapidAPI key and 'YOUR_LOCATION' with the desired location (e.g., 'New York'). Also, don't forget to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your project folder.

This code fetches the weather data from the Yahoo Weather API using RapidAPI, processes the response, and dynamically displays the location, temperature, and description on your weather website.
